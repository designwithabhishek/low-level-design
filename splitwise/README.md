# ðŸ§¾ Splitwise LLD Design

This repository contains the Low-Level Design (LLD) of a Splitwise-like expense sharing system. It focuses on clean object-oriented design, extensibility, and clarity. The system allows users to create groups, add expenses, and split amounts using different strategies (e.g., equal split).
